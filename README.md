# Learning Through Kaggle Competition


## Project Idea

The aim of this project is to gain knowledge through Kaggle Competitions to become a Data Science. The idea is to solve and/or deeply analyze Kaggle competitions, where each action(code) has a clear explanation in orderto master the tools used.

We will learning basic fundamental skills such as 
- DataFrames in pandas, 
- Arrays, matrices, and mathematical functions in Numpy
- Plot figures in matplotlib, 
- Import and train models from scikit-learn.
- Basic Machine Learning models

Also, more advanced topics:

- Generate new features 
- Improve predictions by Nearest Neighbors, Aggregate data and Mean /Target Encoding.
- Tune hyperparameter
- Combine different Machine Learning Models

*I hope that this project help me and others to activate and accelerate the career in data science.*

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
