# Learning Through Kaggle Competition


## About this Project

The aim of this project is to gain knowledge through Kaggle competitions to become a Data Science. The idea is to solve and/or deeply analyze Kaggle competitions, where each action (code) has a clear explanation in order to master the tools used.

We will learn basic, but fundamental skills such as 

- DataFrames in pandas; 
- Arrays, matrices, and mathematical functions in Numpy;
- Plot figures in matplotlib;
- Import and train models from scikit-learn;
- Basic Machine Learning models;

Also, more advanced topics:

- Generate new features; 
- Improve predictions by Nearest Neighbors;
- Aggregate data and Mean /Target encoding;
- Tune hyperparameters;
- Combine different Machine Learning models;

## Note

This project is still running, there will be a presentation at the Fields Institute in this subject, also different models will be compared and reference to the literature will be performed.
