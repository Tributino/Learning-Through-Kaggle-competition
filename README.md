# Learning Through Kaggle Competition


## Project Idea

The aim of this project is to gain knowledge through Kaggle Competitions to become a Data Science. The idea is to solve and/or deeply analyze Kaggle competitions, where each action(code) has a clear explanation in orderto master the tools used.

We will learning basic fundamental skills such as 
- DataFrames in pandas, 
- Arrays, matrices, and mathematical functions in Numpy
- Plot figures in matplotlib, 
- Import and train models from scikit-learn.
- Basic Machine Learning models

Also, more advanced topics:

- Generate new features 
- Improve predictions by Nearest Neighbors, Aggregate data and Mean /Target Encoding.
- Tune hyperparameter
- Combine different Machine Learning Models
